As like other like that, it shows the relative positions of the Sun, Moon and Zodiac constellations. Although it's fast, the \"show\" is astonishing: Just above the main clock are two blue doors that open to reveal the \"The Walk of the Apostles\". Between 9 am and 9 pm, each hour, on the hour, the statues become partially animated with, for example, Death ringing his bell. And, as expected, it's always crowded around the place so it's hard to get a nice view.",

The clock is unique in that, in addition to indicating the 24 hours of the day, the astronomical dial expresses the position of the sun and the moon in the sky, along with other astronomical information. However, the dial is not the unique feature of this complex, historic clock over 600 years old. It’s always the best idea if you can visit during night time.",
